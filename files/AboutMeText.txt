About me Section
I’m happy to see you’re interested in me

UX/UI Designer shifted from the world of education. During 5 years of teaching, staff training, and management, I've honed my skills in communication, 
curriculum development, and problem-solving. These skills help me research, and create a human-centered design. 
My skills include:
User research
Wireframing
Prototyping
User Interface (UI) Design

Usability Testing
Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Videography (Shotcut)
Staff training and managing
Communication and presentation
 I’m passionate about philosophy, psychology, the human experience, and what motivates us. That is why I took coaching and NLP courses alongside more traditional psychology courses. 
I’m an advocate of learning as a means to improve our lives.
I love  practicing photography, acting and writing. I’m into physical and mental health, and value wellbeing .
